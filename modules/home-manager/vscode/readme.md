# VS Code

this is still a bit of a struggle getting extensions to behave...
balancing the versions betweeon pkgs and marketplace is difficult.
basically if its in packages, use it, it's more stable.

Success...
We can create a basic set in here, then...
use Profiles to make the individual settings we need.
I just keep all the profiles in a separate git repo
then I can add update to it without being tied to thesee settings

This also installs most plugins without issue, but I did notice, if you need underlying dependencies, they need to be installed in the default.
