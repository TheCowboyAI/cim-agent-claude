# Compute Resources
These are compute resource configurations for specific functionality.

There are also general templates for building connected application containers.

Instead of building an application directly in your environment, persist it globally as a container.

Any of these can be a separate git module as well.

The advantage to git is that we can control version importing easier than with paths.

We also have the notion of Content Identifiers that we will implement after we have a running Object Store.

These stand separate from NixOS, because they are not restricted to that.

These can be any compute resource. We are capturing a definition that can be deployerd virtually anywhere.
