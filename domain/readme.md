# Domains
A CIM operates on Domains.  While you may think of your business or your personal space as a single domain, it is only those unique ideas and concepts that encapsulate the domain. Domains use things from other domains. 

While this is a personal Domain, we can have many.

Each one of these subjects is essentially it's own "domain" or "category".

These subjects are rigid and the name of the category is very important. These are abstractions of concepts you hold valuable. Surely you will add more, but these are not arbitrary, they have distinct meaning and should be "root" subjects, critical ideas that cannot be further reduced.

Each has a readme.md to tell you about the subject and links to more detailed information about the subject.

Let's look at a few:
  - Facts:
    - PROVEN claims
  - Claims:
    - Ideas that have a repeatable construction
  - Theories:
    - Beliefs with some context, explanation and sources
  - Ideas:
    - Things I think about, but don't necessarily have a theory
  - Arguments:
    - Support for or against a claim
  - Goals:
    - Targets to accomplish
  - 
Essentially, this is a pile of data we use to start.
After we deploy the CIM, it will self contain all the data it uses.

domain: Name for the Category of this Domain
operator: Organization Operating this CIM
accounts: Groups
users: Users (including Agents)

These will be extracted and applied during code generation. importing the yaml also works in nix files.

After we build Language Agents, this will make Domain Expert AIs, and contribute to building a Domain language.

# Be plentiful
The more information we have at the beginning, the more we can tailor appropriate operations and usage patterns.
