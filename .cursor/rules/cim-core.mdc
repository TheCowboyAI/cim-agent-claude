# CIM Core Architecture

## System Overview
CIM (Cognitive Information Management) is a distributed, event-driven system built on:
- **NATS**: Message bus for inter-component communication
- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as events
- **CQRS**: Separation of command and query responsibilities
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Bounded contexts and aggregates

## Core Components

### CIM-SAGE
Universal agent system providing:
- LLM integration through multiple providers
- Event-driven architecture
- NATS-based communication
- Configurable provider backends

### CIM-Domain
Domain modeling and business logic:
- Aggregate roots and entities
- Value objects
- Domain events
- Business rules enforcement

### CIM-Component
Reusable system components:
- Common traits and interfaces
- Shared utilities
- Cross-cutting concerns

### CIM-Subject
Identity and access management:
- User/agent identification
- Authentication primitives
- Authorization contexts

### CIM-IPLD
InterPlanetary Linked Data support:
- Content-addressable storage
- Merkle DAG structures
- Distributed data structures

## Development Practices
- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests first
- **Event Sourcing**: Capture all state changes
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable data structures
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system
- **Error Handling**: Use Result types consistently
